# LoginSystem 
## Introduction :
This is login system created using python and tkinter UI (custom tkinter). Data (username, password, ...) are written in a json file which is not available in the repositorie. The password is crypted before writing in the json file, using crypt module.
## About Crypt :
Crypt is only available on linux and mac, well for future version, im going to try out bcrypt cause of crypt being non secure for modern apps.
## Other :
Well, you will notice a few bugs on tkinter which are really annoying to fix and i still haven't.
